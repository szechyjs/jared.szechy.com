One of my good friends owns one of Ohio’s liquor agencies, they stock hundreds of different bottles of spirits, with prices changing monthly. For internal use product codes are associated with every bottle as well. This seemed like a perfect platform for an Android app. The State of Ohio publishes their updated price list on their website every month. My idea was to have the app pull this price list and parse it out into a database. This database would then be searchable to give the user up-to-date pricing on Ohio’s liquor prices on their Android device.

<!-- more -->

One feature I would like to have completely implemented is the bottle label images. Currently only a few images exist (Captain Morgan, Jim Bean, Jack Daniels…), but I will continue to add more in my free time. These images are stored on my servers, so updates are transparent to the end user.
