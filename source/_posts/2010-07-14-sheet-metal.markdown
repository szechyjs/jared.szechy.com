While working in a metal fabrication shop this summer I did a lot of work with sheet metal.  As you may know sheet metal thickness is on a gauge scale. This scale is different for different materials as well. Needless to say, unless you have a table handy, it is difficult to remember the measured thickness for each gauge material. Surprisingly I was not able to find such an app in the Android Market, so I decided it was a good time to create my first Android App.

The app was rather easy to make. I just hard coded the tables for aluminum, stainless and carbon steel, and have them displayed in a tabbed list view. After ponying up the $25 to publish to the Android Market, my app was now live. After a couple hundred installs, I added some additional features per users requests, such as sheet weight and tolerances.
